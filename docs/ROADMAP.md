# Roadmap

## Immediate Polish

- [ ] Better farmer sprite (actual pixel art or more detailed shapes)
- [ ] Better building art (not just colored boxes)
- [ ] Crop growth animation (subtle bobbing or swaying)
- [ ] Particle effects (dirt when planting, water droplets, harvest sparkles)
- [ ] Screen shake on big actions
- [ ] Day/night cycle visual changes
- [ ] Weather (rain, sunny, cloudy)

## Progression System

- [ ] Experience / Levels
- [ ] Unlock crops as you level up
- [ ] Achievements
- [ ] Stats tracking (total harvested, gold earned, days played)

## Buildings

- [ ] **Sprinkler** - Auto-waters adjacent tiles
- [ ] **Scarecrow** - Prevents random crop damage
- [ ] **Greenhouse** - Grow crops in any season
- [ ] **Storage shed** - Increase inventory capacity
- [ ] **Market stall** - Better sell prices
- [ ] Building placement UI (buy from shop, place on map)
- [ ] Building upgrades

## Automation

- [ ] Sprinkler system (water multiple tiles)
- [ ] Auto-harvest when mature
- [ ] Conveyor belts?
- [ ] Drones?

## World

- [ ] Expandable farmland (buy more plots)
- [ ] Different terrain types (some need clearing)
- [ ] Trees to chop
- [ ] Rocks to mine
- [ ] Fences and paths (decorative)

## Social

- [ ] NPCs that visit
- [ ] Simple dialogue system
- [ ] Quests ("Grow 10 pumpkins")
- [ ] Town area to visit

## Quality of Life

- [ ] Save/Load (localStorage)
- [ ] Settings menu (sound volume, controls)
- [ ] Tutorial for new players
- [ ] Undo last action?
- [ ] Speed controls for automation

## Juice Ideas

- [ ] Camera slight follow on farmer movement
- [ ] Dust particles when walking
- [ ] Ambient bird sounds
- [ ] Music that changes with seasons
- [ ] Crop shadows
- [ ] Wind effect on mature crops
- [ ] Fireflies at dusk
- [ ] Footprints in soil

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Consider splitting Game.jsx if it grows past 2000 lines
- [ ] Extract constants to separate file
- [ ] Extract sound system to separate file
- [ ] Add TypeScript?
